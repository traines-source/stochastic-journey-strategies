# Stochastic Strategies for Public Transport Journeys Based on Realtime Delay Predictions

This project aims to provide an implementation of an algorithm for stochastic journey planning for public transport. It relies on the delay distributions obtained from [public-transport-statistics](https://github.com/traines-source/public-transport-statistics) and will be a dependency of [time-space-train-planner](https://github.com/traines-source/time-space-train-planner), which provides the UI and middleware.
